## Introduction

Ta Eftar shows how long is remaining until Iftar. Muslims at Ramadan get fasts every day until Maghrib and this project
shows much left until they can break they fast.
This project originally created by Fandogh team, but it left unmaintained. This fork is created to lunch it in GitHub.
Ta Eftar is only useful in Iran and you can use it in Iran's cities that are defined in code.
